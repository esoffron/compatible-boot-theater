Small patch to Charles Mangin's awesome web page that displays 4AM's Apple II crack movies.

### NEW for Marchintosh 2023: Now also has a version with 4AM's Mac boot videos! #MARCHintosh

Charles' orgiginal was hard-coded to use the smaller Ogg video files. Ogg video doesn't work in Safari or in the Mac WebViewScreenSaver (https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver).  This version will use MPEG4 in Safari and WebViewScreenSaver, but probably won't work in Chrome / Edge / Firefox.

Tested with Mac Safari 10.1.2, Mac Firefox 54.0, Mac Chrome 59.0.3071.115, and Edge on Windows 10 (but seems to break on newer browser versions other than Safari).
