Small patch to Charles Mangin's awesome web page that displays 4AM's Apple II crack movies.

Charles' orgiginal was hard-coded to use the smaller Ogg video files. Ogg video doesn't work in Safari or in the Mac WebViewScreenSaver (https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver).  This version tries to use Ogg, but if it detects Ogg won't work it will use MPEG4.

Tested with Mac Safari 10.1.2, Mac Firefox 54.0, Mac Chrome 59.0.3071.115, and Edge on Windows 10.
