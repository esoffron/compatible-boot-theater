<!-- MAC BOOT THEATER, by Charles Mangin                            -->
<!-- Requires Javascript. Utilizes the 4am Mac boot video           -->
<!-- collection to provide an endless grid of booting Mac           -->
<!-- programs for whatever reason you might need that.              -->

<!-- Updated by @soffronoff@mastodon.social to work with Safari     -->
<!-- and to get around some changes in the API at Internet Archive  -->
<!-- and make launch faster and to make sure the same video doesn't -->
<!-- display on the screen at the same time.                        -->

<!-- It's less dynamic but also a lot less fiddly.  Years on and    -->
<!-- Safari still doesn't do native OGG...                          -->

<!-- Fast version with hardcoded Mac URLs - no runtime lookups      -->
<!-- MUTED VERSION - plays videos silently                          -->
